                    policy, consultancy and decision making. Our objective is to ensure effective formulation and
                    implementation of laws in order to improve governance for the public good. Our approach is based on
                    three I’s that is Innovation, implementation and influence with the sole aim to create large social
                    impact. Every aspect of our work is driven by a comprehensive and an impartial agenda and by the
                    need to propagate ideas that advance justice. Quality and objectivity are our two core values. Apart
                    from implementation, innovation also calls for collaboration and therefore our effort constantly
                    calls for engaging with various stakeholders such as Government of India, various State Governments,
                    public and

                knowledge, findings research work and their respective methodologies are shared with
                varied audiences from time to time. And the most important aspect is that we do this with a mindset of
                accountability and transparency. The only irreplaceable capital an organization possesses is the
                knowledge and ability of its people. The productivity of that capital depends on how effectively people
                share their competence with those who can use it. To achieve this we have a well-qualified
                multi-disciplinary team drawn from academia, civil services, armed forces and retired bureaucrats who
                along with their experience also bring diversity in their views. Everyone has complete autonomy to
                express their individual views. Our research and policy recommendations do not subscribe to any
                particular political view or interest or any religion. We have been in active association with NAULA
                FOUNDATION for Water Conservation related Works and Programmes in India.</div>
