        <div class="ai-img"><img src="./images/5. articles/2.jpg" alt=""></div>

        <div class="ai-p">‘You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink’
            India houses 1,391,568,121people. That's a tremendously large population. Leading and administering this big
            a demographic has always been a huge challenge, inoculating and maintaining herd immunity for the same
            population in a time of unpredictability, panic and loss was never going to be easy.</div>


        <div class="ai-p">India's exceptionalism in "beating" the epidemic early on - younger population, native
            immunity, a largely rural population - and declaring victory on the virus turned out to be cruelly
            premature. India’s second wave was fueled by people letting their guard down, non-compliance to safety
            protocols, attending weddings and social gatherings, reluctance towards vaccination, some mixed signals from
            the government and the Indian healthcare infrastructure being overwhelmed. The second wave was inevitable,
            we knew that, we had seen it happen in many nations, we had been warned as well, but if we all had not
            adopted a casual approach to the virus which killed millions worldwide, we could have lessened the impact.
            One thing to notice is how we put the entire blame for logistical shortcomings on government. People are
            putting oxygen and other medicines on the black market, selling the same on ridiculously high prices in a
            time when millions of lives are on stake, doctors are reporting deaths days later to keep billing for the
            hospital bed. Don't take this the wrong way, many people have shown that humanity still exists, many have
            made tremendous efforts to help the ones in need, and the doctors and nurses have sacrificed so much
            personally to serve their nation and people, saving countless lives as well. But where is the individual
            accountability? Taking advantage of the masses when they are panicking
            or in grieving is not exactly saintly behavior. The nation's leadership has given innumerable funding to
            state governments, given them liberty to lockdown their state according to the situation there and the
            states are doing their best as well. It's understandable that people are losing their health, loved ones and
            are desperate and angry but a pandemic cannot be dealt with within a few weeks. And the media is especially
            impatient.</div>

        <div class="ai-p">A lot of the news they report are misleading or exaggerated, adding to the despair of the
            present times, using Covid tragedy as a propaganda instrument. Photojournalists are making money out of the
            pandemic by clicking photos at crematoriums, denying dignity at the tragic deaths of Covid-19 victims. This
            is not to say that everything the media reports is brainwashing. And the journalists are also putting their
            lives on stake to go into the field and gather information, write news pieces, and present the news in an
            honest and balanced manner. But we can also not deny that the second wave was more devastating and deadly
            due to regional mutant variants, and the media is selling this human tragedy for their vested interest
            through aggrandizing. They need to learn the difference between holding the government accountable and
            defaming it on international platforms.</div>

        <div class="ai-p">
            Playing the blame game is of no use, every country’s healthcare system failed at some point, recovered and
            got back on track, tackling the pandemic. India handled the first wave with unparalleled efficiency and
            grace along with supporting the worst hit nations around the world through extensive exporting of vaccines
            and medical supplies. Indian vaccine manufacturing is a precious asset to the world. When you put out good
            into the world, the good comes back to you and indeed it did. Numerous nations have sent aid to back up
            India's efforts to respond to the pandemic. The nations who do not have the capacity to send aid right now
            are contacting Indian government to boost their morale. All extended solidarity to the people of India in
            this crisis and thanked for our support when they were in the same situation.
        </div>
        <div class="ai-p">
            If States and Centre work to coordinate their efforts in advocating changes in social behavior and support
            each other in implementing the necessary protocols to fight the virus, among these being the speedy
            distribution of medicine, vaccine and medical equipment, we can have a more positive and constructive path
            in battling Covid-19 and other challenges which lie ahead.
        </div>
        <div class="ai-p">
            Simply put, we need to stop throwing accusations and listen to the warnings of medical experts and comply
            with government issued safety protocols. We didn't before and the fact that hospitals are turning away
            patients for lack of beds, people dying of oxygen and lifesaving drugs shortage and burial grounds running
            out of space is evidence enough. This unprecedented rise in cases and deaths should be more than enough to
            prompt us to work on our social behavior. And let’s not forget that besides COVID-19 we must also battle
            misinformation and toxic media. As Barack Obama said once,
            'Our Country Is Only as Strong as the Character of Our People'
            These are trying times, the desperation and anger among masses is understandable, but giving in to despair
            and negativity cannot be afforded at this juncture. Let’s pray for the safety for our fellow citizens and do
            our bits to make the situation better, no matter how small the contribution.
