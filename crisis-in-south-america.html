        <div class="ai-p">Venezuela, at the moment, is undergoing a serious humanitarian crisis and suffers one of most
            severe cases up to date of hyperinflation. The demise of Hugo Chavez denoted a defining moment for the
            political, social, and financial circumstance in Venezuela. Nicolas Maduro, who was the Vice-President at
            the hour of Chavez's passing, rose to control. With an egalitarian and intensely communist government and
            the remainings of Hugo Chavez's questionable organization, the nation before long fell into conflict. Social
            discontent started to surface as it was striking for individuals that the socialist reforms were
            unreasonable, as the government battled to monetarily support itself with the crippling debt the
            administration acquired. Supporters of Chávez and Maduro have said that the problems result from an
            "economic war" on Venezuela and "falling oil prices, international sanctions, and the country's business
            elite" while critics of the government say the cause is "years of economic mismanagement, and corruption".
        </div>


        <div class="ai-p">The crisis also resulted from the regime’s multiple violations of the rule of law and the
            Venezuelan Constitution, which, on 20 May 2018, culminated in the holding of presidential elections lacking
            in transparency and credibility and held in oppressive circumstances, which invited backlash and sanctions
            from the international community. Nicolas Maduro, who claimed to be the winner, enjoys no legitimacy based
            on that claim. The President of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, became interim President, not propped up
            by military control or foreign support but through respect for the Constitution of Venezuela, in order to
            organize the holding of new, free, credible and transparent presidential elections.</div>

        <div class="ai-p">The Government made a move in what might start perhaps the most squeezing philanthropic
            emergencies on the planet right now as the resistance emerged. Right now, Venezuela has endured perhaps the
            most extreme cases of out of control inflation, more than 6800 political deaths, the return of recently
            ridden sicknesses, instances of rampant corruption and associations with the Brazilian OdeBrecht defilement
            outrage, a populace mass migration, and a dire humanitarian emergency with lack of food and resources. With
            the shocking circumstance being lived, the global community calls for intercession. Venezuela has been
            confronting a monetary
            emergency that has brought about high paces of swelling. The swelling rate was "65.37 thousand" percent
            higher than 1 (IMF 2020). The inflation rates have dropped altogether in Venezuela, yet swelling rates are
            still at amazing highs. Venezuela is under Socialist guideline, and financial limitations have controlled
            how essential assets are conveyed to Venezuelans. Venezuela's first Socialist pioneer, Hugo Chavez,
            represented Venezuela from 1999-2013, and his rule was described by the passing of numerous Socialist
            changes (Venezuela's Chavez Era, cfr.org). Hugo Chavez preceeded Nicolas Maduro, who was his successor.
            Nicolas Maduro continued with Chavez's Socialist inheritance after he was elected in 2014. Venezuela’s
            infrastructure began to collapse under Maduro caused by years of socialist policies, incompetence and
            corruption.</div>

        <div class="ai-p">
            To battle the impacts of the poverty that excessive inflation caused, unfamiliar philanthropies are
            conveying products to guarantee that Venezuelans endure (Reuters Staff 2019). Venezuela has primarily been
            getting help and resources from global NGOs. Despite the fact that numerous charities have been reliably
            appropriating products to guarantee that Venezuelans endure, the lack of resources has tormented numerous
            Venezuelans. There is as yet a deficiency of access to medication, regardless of the endeavors of various
            charities to disperse help (Lancet, 2018).
        </div>
        <div class="ai-p">
            The swelling rates of the Venezuelan bolivar have been gradually falling. This was likely credited to the
            way that Venezuela has been represented by Juan Guaido since 2019 (BBC 2019). Guaido has been endeavoring to
            turn around a portion of the policies that were instituted under the Maduro administration that caused
            hyperinflation in Venezuela. Despite the fact that Guaido was chosen by the Venezuelan individuals, Nicolas
            Maduro actually has some control over the Venezuelan government. A coup has not been executed by Guaido or
            any foreign powers that oppose Maduro's rule. The U.N. resolutions that have been implemented with respect
            to the expansion emergency and the outcomes of excessive inflation in Venezuela are S/2019-186 that was a
            draft goal that vowed deliver basic resources to Venezuelans (Security Council Report 2019). The need to
            convey these resources originated, evidently, from the significant expenses of living that stemmed from the
            out of control inflation emergency, making significant degrees of vagrancy and powerlessness access medical
            care.
        </div>
        <div class="ai-p">
            There can be a political and economic, peaceful solution to the crisis, since the origins of the ongoing
            crisis are political and institutional, and such a solution
            involves the holding of democratic presidential elections as soon as possible under a new National Electoral
            Council and international monitoring. The second goal is to allow the delivery of international aid, in
            accordance with international humanitarian principles, so as to meet the urgent needs of the Venezuelan
            people. On the fiscal side, a stabilization plan should focus primarily on reallocating rather than reducing
            spending. We call on the Venezuelan regime to demonstrate humanity and facilitate access for United Nations
            agencies and non-governmental organizations to carry out their activities in the country aimed at
            alleviating the suffering of the Venezuelan people. Although Venezuela is on the edge of precipice, our
            responsibility is to provide the once again with a voice and allow them to express themselves freely to
            reclaim their destiny through the rule of law in Venezuela.
